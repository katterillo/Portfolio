## Inspiration
We both wanted to work on a personal project and experiment with some web-development outside of traditional academics. We both noticed that applications for SWE positions commonly requested a personal website and thought this would be a good project to do in order to learn React. We learned a lot by attending the React workshop hosted by Neel.

## What it does
This is a portfolio website that presents information to the user that is commonly needed in the hiring process. 

## How we built it
We utilized the React.js library to create a user-friendly website and used Tailwind CSS to style it. 
## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulty in using Tailwind CSS at first but reading through documentation helped us solve any styling problems. One of us had difficulty in using React's router but the other teammate managed to implement it correctly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have built a functioning and responsive website! The both of us have only used React in workshops so we're proud to have created a complete product.

## What we learned
We learned React and one of us learned Tailwind CSS.

## What's next for Personal Website 
We'll be making our own edits to this portfolio so it suits each of us better, and we are planning to host our portfolios on GitHub pages.
